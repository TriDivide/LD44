This is my submission For Ludum Dare  44, The theme is your life is currency.

To generate the levels, A 3rd party library was used. This was developed by LoneDevDotCom. Link to code: https://github.com/lonedevdotcom/MazeGenerator
To get Nav meshes working I used a High level library available from Unity Technologies. Link to code: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents
Controls: use the mouse to rotate, WASD keys to move.
